Description
SysOut is a project based on React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a minimal configuration for running React with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

backend/: Contains the backend server code, including controllers, models, and routes.
runners/: Contains scripts for running MongoDB and React.
SysOut/: Contains the frontend application code, including components, styles, and Vite configuration.
Backend
The backend is an Express application that uses MongoDB as a database. It also uses sockets for real-time communication.

Frontend
The frontend is a React application that uses TypeScript for static typing. It also uses Vite for fast module reloading.

How to Run the Project
To run the project, you first need to start the backend by running the runMongo.sh script in the runners/ directory. Then, you can start the frontend application by running the runReact.sh script in the same directory.

ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type lint rules:

Replace plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended with plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked or plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked. Optionally add plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked. Install eslint-plugin-react and add plugin:react/recommended & plugin:react/jsx-runtime to the extends list.
